Check the free Kahoot! Play app here in Microsoft Store.)\r\n\r\nCreate a kahoot in minutes\r\nCreating a new game (we call them ‘kahoots’) is quick and easy. You can make a classic quiz with a series of multiple choice questions or try our new game format, Jumble, where answers have to be placed in the correct order. Add videos, images and diagrams to make the game even more engaging. \r\n\r\nChoose from millions of existing kahoots\r\nBesides creating your own kahoots, you can find an existing one around your topic. Play it as it is, or duplicate and edit it to customize the game for your class.\r\n\r\nBring fun into the classroom\r\nKahoots are best played in a group setting, like a classroom. Players answer the questions on their own devices, while games are displayed on a shared screen to unite the lesson. \r\nIt creates a ‘campfire moment’ encouraging players to look up and celebrate together. \r\n\r\nFoster social learning\r\nSocial learning promotes discussion and pedagogical impact, whether players are in the same room or on the other side of the globe. After a game, encourage players to create and share their own kahoots to deepen understanding, mastery and purpose, as well as engage in peer-led discussions.

However, Bandicut is able to cut quickly between \"any frames\" that the user selects.\r\n\r\nBandicut supports two cutting methods, [High-Speed mode] and [Encoding mode]. \r\n\"High-speed mode\" allows the user to cut a video precisely without re-encoding, as a result the quality is lossless and the cutting speed is faster than any other software.\r\n\"Encoding mode\" allows re-encoding if the user wishes to change the codec, resolution or quality of a video according to their needs.\r\n\r\nThe user can save the video as an AVI or MP4 file.\r\nBandicut supports common codecs such as H.264, Xvid, MPEG-1 and Motion JPEG, and various video formats such as *.avi, *.mp4, *.mov, *.m4v, *.mkv, *.mpeg, *.mpg, *.dat, *.vob, *.flv, *.asf, *.wmv, *.ts, *.tp, *.trp, *.mpe, *.mpv2, *.mp2v, *.m2t, *.m2ts, *.k3g, *.divx, *.wm, *.wmx, *.wvx, *.rm, *.rmvb, *.ram, *.ivf, *.ogm, *.vp6 and *.xvd.\r\n\r\nBandicut also supports hardware acceleration using Intel Quick Sync Video provided your CPU has this functionality. It will allow users to cut videos at high speed with excellent and lossless quality.\r\n\r\n* Term) Frame and Keyframe\r\n- Frame: A frame is a single shot of a series of still transparent pictures that form a video. (A frame contains partial information of a still scene.)\r\n- Keyframe: A keyframe is a frame used to indicate the beginning or end of a change made to the signal. A video file has a limited number of keyframes - not every frame is a keyframe.
