Wield magic cards instead of weapons and slay the armies of darkness in the dungeons below the Old Cathedral. Save the terror-stricken Paperverse from the clutches of the Archdemon himself! \r\n\r\nCARDS AND DECKBUILDING\r\nIt’s not a card game, but items, spells, and skills are all expressed as cards. The strategy lies in adapting your hand to each situation. Cards can be upgraded with runes and you can find many variants with diverse bonuses. Legendaries are the most epic but hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nTAILORED SESSIONS WITH FLEXISCOPE\r\nBook of Demons respects your time. It features the Flexiscope engine which allows you to divide the game into sessions of any size. It even learns your pace of gaming and predicts the time to complete the next session.\r\n\r\nUNIQUE MECHANICS\r\nSimplified movement and fight mechanics is where Book of Demons differs the most from other hack & slash games. There is often not enough time to click-remove all of the obstacles such as monster shields, enemy spells, poison, or knocked cards, so timing, card selection and order of execution are critical.\r\n\r\nHACK & SLASH IN THE WORLD OF PAPERVERSE\r\nBook of Demons takes place in Paperverse, a world that exists entirely inside a pop-up book. It’s a tale of good and evil about saving the world from the ultimate devilry. Sounds familiar? Inspired by the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the first Diablo game, Book of Demons is part tribute part parody of hack & slash classics.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT OF GAMEPLAY\r\nMany Book of Demons features were designed with gameplay comfort in mind. Points of interest are marked at the top of the screen and get revealed once you get closer. Your character leaves footprints, which can be used to track your way back or notice paths already visited without opening the map.\r\n\r\nCHALLENGING ENDGAME\r\nOn average it takes about 10 hours to complete the campaign with a single class, but maxing out a character and mastering all of the higher Freeplay difficulty levels and Quests takes much longer. The Roguelike mode offers another level of challenge with permadeath, restricted healing and even more obstacles to overcome.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VBTC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Myths of Orion HD (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63882.13510798887499350.e3c16bf4-4981-4349-b50b-ce1e53ee674e.f27ebe7c-332d-442e-a3e4-2da50774a28d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47181.13510798887499350.5d3126b3-de5d-466c-984e-7600b2f7aec6.859d9162-d815-4b28-a3c8-b317e8c95b92","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50177.13510798887499350.0e550138-0e19-4b70-b9ed-a233700c1e0f.89eadc3a-d9ec-4d41-9b5a-5d4b7ebbd6bd","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25810.13510798887499350.95e2025b-ab99-4fbe-9825-41d9561bd94e.f7c31464-465a-40d5-a61e-1eb1e1946695","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.363.13510798887499350.4b5e9ef5-e459-4054-aa55-df2bf2ca4860.26428356-0a64-4475-9509-b5332544c19b","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16133.13510798887499350.eab6f5cb-925f-4260-80da-6daa0babcb12.d1692300-997e-43ff-a9f1-f6d58887121a","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹379.00","Price":379.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.MythsofOrionHDFull_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["4b856eb2-ee0b-621f-9ac8-e9f8ca575d99"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Recover three powerful books and return peace and prosperity to the Realm of Orion! \r\nThe whole world is at stake, as the minions of an evil wizard are doing their best to deliver the Books of Knowledge, Law and Magic to their master.

Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic. \r\n\r\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\r\n \r\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced.

try the aerobatic simulator licensed by the U.S. Navy!\r\n\r\nExperience flight at 400 mph just 18 inches from your partner’s wing and face the challenge of official maneuvers aboard F/A-18 fighter jets and a C-130 transport aircraft. An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level. This will give the you best scores and you will reach the top of the leaderboard!\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- F/A-18 fighter jets and C-130 “Fat Albert” transport aircraft\r\n- Innovative formation flying and assisted guidance system \r\n- All official Blue Angels maneuvers, playable in all roles\r\n- All configurations: takeoff, diamond, delta, echelon, line abreast and soloist\r\n\r\n- Use Airshow Mode to complete a real exhibition with a custom sequence of maneuvers\r\n- Additive Mode to create your aerobatic figure\r\n- Special missions: free flight, exploratory, pursuit and C-130 JATO\r\n\r\n- 3D Briefing display for easy understanding of the maneuver\r\n- Innovative help system with three difficulty levels to suit both beginners and more experienced pilots\r\n- Accurate trajectory measurement system for evaluation of the score\r\n\r\n- 3D virtual cockpit\r\n- Multi-camera replay system with dynamic views\r\n- 3D exploratory area to deepen knowledge of the aircraft","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH598WH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fairy Tale Mysteries (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9443.13510798886920934.d39da32b-46bf-4c62-8251-66eb2e511fb8.e44388c5-b50a-4225-9903-e6cf2be67214","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹379.00","Price":379.0,"AverageRating":2.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.FairyTaleMysteriesFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["eaf1abff-5ec2-a6f9-594b-1561cd4c170a","3ae10f01-edcd-1137-3793-7d2a4bf08320"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,మొబైల్","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nTry the remastered edition of the wonderful, classic adventure game!\r\n\r\nWhen evil Puppeteer kidnaps souls of innocent children, you're assigned your first mission as Brothers Grimm's investigator - find a way to defeat the malefactor and bring rescue to all in need.

Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meirwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.\r\n\r\nProtect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CTZ5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Oxenfree","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29438.13510798886631184.a7086f9d-aff6-44c8-99a4-736fca70745e.bfb4096f-8acb-49f7-8947-97f6967b66ed","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22649.13510798886631184.af323053-1e0d-4a44-bf7d-f8b2f9a21406.b4be9504-2e8f-4e51-a575-d0d41aa7cfeb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53490.13510798886631184.74ffc18d-7b82-4341-acbe-f0b94477c98a.c7ab633a-76da-41ab-87b6-74b05d841d8b","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13365.13510798886631184.a6e698aa-58bc-407b-942d-175add4ea314.de4563e7-f967-43f3-9aff-c469daf90635","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹1,099.00","Price":1099.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["NightSchoolStudio.Oxenfree_d2rtnv6z4qwgr"],"ContentIds":["cff3810d-f476-c86b-87d8-26b4e994efd3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SUMMER 2016's HUGE CONTENT UPDATE: The most mind bending game of the year has new storylines, scenes, and endings, plus a multi-episode behind-the-scenes documentary. \r\n\r\nOxenfree is a supernatural thriller about a group of friends who unwittingly open a ghostly rift.

Harry at the End of the World is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, in the vain of Samorost and Machinarium, where solving puzzles comes with a sense of discovery and accomplishment. This gameplay style, merged with unique artstyle inspired by 15th century engravings, creates the perfect backdrop for a story about heartbreak, redemption and, quite literally, the end of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Apocalipsis you play as Harry, for whom the loss of his beloved was the end of his world. Now he has to venture out into the strange, unwelcoming lands to get her back. On his journey he will meet fantastical creatures, straight from the minds of artists from the 15th century Europe, and ultimately conquer his own, personal demons. \r\nFeaturing the narration by Nergal, leader of the band Behemoth, with the added atmospheric new rendition of Behemoth's music, it will be a journey to remember.\r\n\r\nApocalipsis shares with the Middle Ages its artstyle and the game’s world itself is inspired by Book of Revelation and steeped in medieval philosophy and beliefs, with the story taking cues from Dante Alighieri’s “Divine Comedy”.\r\nEvery location and character in Apocalipsis was inspired by classical woodcuts by 15th and 16th century artists such as Hans Holbein, Michael Wolgemut, and Albrecht Dürer. This pairing of medieval art and philosophy with video games creates something unique, like you’ve never seen before.\r\n\r\nCome, let us take you on a journey you will not forget!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PCTTQSPSVLR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Surface: Virtual Detective","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43373.14162801897250380.2642d647-4b55-456b-9502-11e3477bd1f6.f78f7d9f-b790-473f-a4d9-6fccefb3eb0c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44554.14162801897250380.2642d647-4b55-456b-9502-11e3477bd1f6.cd5224cc-6c16-409f-8ad6-50cad8e12444","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53270.14162801897250380.4a9d8da9-fcd4-429d-9d55-53e5505970d9.7e0e2360-39e6-4911-a1e6-510b2e268f71","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48061.14162801897250380.4a9d8da9-fcd4-429d-9d55-53e5505970d9.b0cc9b59-bc2f-40ef-ae88-62b381dcb831","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹549.00","Price":549.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.SurfaceVirtualDetective_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["fad953b7-ec63-68ab-8330-bfa3f5e182a0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Elephant Games, the studio that created Mystery Trackers and Haunted Hotel proudly present their latest hidden-object puzzle adventure in the innovative Surface series!\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Detective Agency is now hiring!

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score.

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG2GW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Supermarket Management 2 HD (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.39647.9007199266304656.86055cab-849d-419e-bb36-e2332ae6dda8.4ea5d28b-203e-4047-b645-5145ccc9e4ce","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13931.9007199266304656.c4eb9a0c-ae0a-406b-ac63-ed23e9d8d43b.3803b10c-2a44-46a6-823e-99e53f851ed2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44960.9007199266304656.5a13e8fe-59ce-445d-ba76-4296f460e077.d482e5da-db8f-4c4a-88a5-dec892fd37db","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42706.9007199266304656.d75fd4e6-30fa-4f4e-a872-2d672477a031.c7e5a758-454e-4a53-8922-a3427c71c713","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41008.9007199266304656.c70e159a-53d5-4cbc-bd3b-76d2c56dbf9e.305f476f-7ea4-4c0d-bde1-825909a9d0f2","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.364.9007199266304656.8c08f2a6-a558-4486-9c6c-c351886af378.b5caf662-17ce-448b-8137-bc2352d3270f","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹379.00⁺","Price":379.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"14","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SupermarketManagementFull_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["69095475-4355-4049-ada5-7ea7173cc909"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you have what it takes to run a busy supermarket?

Areas that are under immense strain are colored bright red, while other areas are colored green.

While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDP614","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Battleship HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1820.9007199266620373.7e4540e2-28f1-43aa-be82-beb3b46a42c3.816ddde2-80f4-4b08-938c-5a328bfbebf1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53931.9007199266620373.3e1597c5-9412-4e9a-bf86-876b5c7bce71.6b5c4776-b409-47a9-9671-569a5e18ffa4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7768.9007199266620373.b0986fa3-7817-4d5c-b0ac-153a893d631c.4489f01a-9fc7-4a4e-89ec-50b4ab419835","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58401.9007199266620373.6f851231-81f3-4918-b312-55cbf0465238.81fea06c-9a66-47af-a6d1-4acbeea8dd3b","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12364.9007199266620373.52c6b545-8621-44df-8da1-4f99a68341db.8923baba-74bb-4448-bd9e-58b557d65d6c","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44037.9007199266620373.05ec4565-c312-435a-9ce6-8df994a0a716.a9a9b2ec-0723-4ac1-9491-b3c7fff19bf4","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹164.00⁺","Price":164.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["60443Team0.9.BattleshipHD_y9gkwrg37da2r"],"ContentIds":["e399c92c-727e-194f-99f4-b26e8f9c5751"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Battleship - a classic strategic game for two people, but with additional weapons, making the game more exciting and addictive.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

Moreover, the bank has set this land aside for the construction of an entire city, and if Margaret isn't up to the task the banker won't miss his chance to tease our unlucky friends.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4XBSN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Five Nights at Granny's Revelations","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25610.13510798887543659.1dd80de7-61b8-4616-84f9-d3655b72016e.654dd5fb-524b-4cba-854d-171baf77539b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59479.13510798887543659.07027c59-6bf4-463d-b1a2-c8c6b99b4a69.508e2162-44b8-49b5-a8f4-7e3a262b1e03","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10909.13510798887543659.083884a9-dcef-4483-bbec-09a6575d9368.58fddd9d-2e22-41ad-9a6c-dcc5075dfe2a","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47781.13510798887543659.81f0690a-5b53-42ea-9821-dba8acf70ef0.f3a60ba1-6c3c-4859-b69b-2f0db5a9302c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47019.13510798887543659.94ea9f56-dfc9-43d9-9bd0-8ec7c073bb53.4b5bb794-6f45-41d8-b751-df2da6e69a13","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4095.13510798887543659.d77092de-03d3-443d-ac1e-f9b9a43cf771.2f5b5495-a3a9-4045-8340-697e71fdfffa","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3551.13510798887543659.9ea3bec8-a5ed-47d3-ac8d-0f3374b4fb17.79f7656d-e0f9-403b-a3be-58aad14ab76f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14385.13510798887543659.f9df5963-1fa2-4433-865a-73b025f273eb.0054d7d6-dcfd-4c97-8067-054874e919f0","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37084.13510798887543659.e1ef0e69-5656-4f85-8eae-1d29765eccd4.e51985ef-9e9d-43cc-84e9-ac1ccc92c45c","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹109.00","Price":109.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["45679ZealousDreams.FiveNightsatGrannysRevelations_6209jy6j60fh4"],"ContentIds":["65472948-a135-65ff-cbd8-9fad8efac9ee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"New Five Nights is here with a completely new style and design making FNAG the best in the market.

With an endless gameplay, Floaties will keep you hooked as you travel 8 different worlds filled with specific obstacles. All you have to do is tap to keep the characters floating, but the easy controls are balanced by an almost impossible gameplay. Dare to take this challenge?\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n✔ Endless Floating Gameplay. Control up to 4 “floaties” at the same time each with its own color by simply tapping to help them float. Each floatie is immune to the same color obstacles but is destroyed instantly by obstacles with other colors. Your main goal is to have a fleet of all colors and to try surviving the longest. Easy to play, but impossible to survive for long!\r\n\r\n✔ 8 Adventurous Worlds. Help your floaties survive through the ancient world of Egypt, the sci-fi landscape of the Moon, the unlawful Wild Wild West, the dangerous Jurassic Park and more. Each of the 8 playable worlds feature its own particularities depicted in eye-catching 3D graphics so get ready to dodge out-of-orbit satellites on the Moon, T-Rex bones in Jurassic Park and hundreds others!\r\n\r\n✔ Dozens of Characters. From flying drones, chicken, rockets to E.T., Cleopatra or even Jack the pirate you can unlock more than 40 different fun characters. Collect coins throughout the game and use those to spin the wheel of fortune to get a new random character or unlock your favorite one. Gain experience with each character and level them up to 5 stars!\r\n\r\n✔ Powerups and abilities. Aside coins you can collect special objects that help you gain powerups for a limited time (i.e. collect 4 potion bottles to double your coin collection for 15 seconds). With your new abilities you’ll survive longer and score higher. \r\n\r\n✔ Solve Quests. Each world has a theoretically endless flying/floating gameplay, although in reality you die A LOT, but offers side quests too. Can you collect 7 items of the same color? Or have one of RGBY floatie destroyed a couple of times? The more quests you solve, the tougher that level gets. You start at Easy, advance to Medium and become a master when you reach the Hard level of difficulty.\r\n\r\n✔ Achievements & Leaderboards. Connect via Google Play Services to unlock more achievements and access the social or global leaderboards if your score is high enough. You’ll also be able to analyze the statistics for each world, such as how many items you’ve collected, how many quests you’ve completed, what was the best score and MUCH MORE!\r\n\r\n✔ Multiplayer Challenges. Provoke up to 4 of your friends to a game of keeping floating characters alive! You can play the game in multiplayer mode and this gives 4 users the chance to play Floaties on the same device. Who can be the best? Only practice will tell!\r\n\r\nAside surviving all sorts of entrapments that destroy Floaties of a different color (i.e. than the obstacle color) you must collect coins, power-ups and character resurrection items. Play often and you will be able to get free coins too by pulling the handle of a slot machine. The same game will unlock a random character for 100 coins.\r\n\r\nEach world you play in features awesome 3D graphics and well designed characters that create a great gaming experience especially accompanied by an entertaining soundtrack and sounds.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU for downloading, playing and rating Floaties!

profession. Amanda for example is an experienced pilot and an experienced rescuer. In her long career she has saved over hundred people that lost themselves in the desert. We all know that many people decide to take a holiday in this kind of place and the desert seems like eternal space and people tired from the sun often lose themselves there in case they don't have a proper guidance. On the other hand, people who live around the desert also could get in to trouble and Amanda is always here to help. By flying she has a great perspective of the whole desert so she could see very easy who is asking for help.\r\n\r\nToday Amanda has a little bit different case. Namely, she got a call for rescue of a tourist who has entered deeply into the desert with his jeep. This man entered into the dessert and every trace of him is lost, as he wasn't there at all. Amanda usually has some kind of trace but this time she starts from zero. She accepts the challenge and starts flying over the dessert.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain period of time Amanda sees the jeep but she can't see the lost tourists. This is the first trace so far so she lands near the jeep and starts her investigation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Do you like sword fighting? So how about using a Narwhals horn as a sword, and choppin other Narwhals up?! The concept of this game is so incredibly simple but so much fun, I’ve been playing it for just over half an hour now and I’m already hooked! The arena size is reasonably small which means a whole ton of action, you’ll never get the chance to sit still with over 20 other players launching themselves at you.\r\n\r\nHow to play\r\nThe objective of the game is simple, slice other Narwhales in half whilst avoiding being sliced in half yourself. Everytime you kill an opponent you will gain a bunch of stat buffs such as movement speed, a stronger horn, faster turning, stamina increase and a whole lot more! Be very wary of other Narwhals as if their horns connect with your body you will be sliced in half, however to avoid oncoming attacks try to crash into them with your head as that way you’ll both simply bounce off each other.\r\n\r\nControls\r\nEverything in Narwhale is done via mouse, move your character through your cursor and use the left click to lunge at your enemies.\r\n\r\nThis player will allow you to open your favorite web games inside a self-contained UWP app.  This allows better performance, privacy, and security.  Download all your favorites: diep io (diep.io), Zombs Royale (zombsroyale.io), Agario (agar.io), Slitherio (slither.io), Paper.io (paper.io) and tons more directly from the Windows Store!  Note that  you are paying for the player itself, not the game.  The game can be accessed through a browser normally, but our player provides a more hands-free solution.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NNKH5L42LZ8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tiles ❒","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34575.13736823158155009.47503cb6-e5b5-4b75-8039-6628c5e47579.76e1b75a-8666-4963-9c53-24532ffdb81e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12023.13736823158155009.c0008363-75a7-446b-96ec-a6350054da47.b3e575b5-1380-4f00-a3c9-2bb46412a4bd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29810.13736823158155009.94567dc9-2c54-467a-9444-68cb1529cb21.4ff85901-5272-46dd-9bfc-4e1cb9f67bf2","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33069.13736823158155009.b247e419-3b45-44d2-84d8-08b95aa65b09.b58bcf56-6599-4b0b-980e-724269ab09f7","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹219.00","Price":219.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["RomansIXVIGamingLLC.13579E1E58BC2_xd88kn857g87p"],"ContentIds":["ac968067-a153-e9d6-d7f8-2f562ffb000c","5450e5eb-c4d5-9074-d8e5-618b19754660"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tiles is a fast-paced action puzzle game that will both convolute your mind and burn your finger tips!\n\nPlay\nIt's simple, get from the green tile to the red whilst clearing the blue tiles in between.

It is believed that this two-player board game originated as a popular form of recreation with both royalty and peasantry. But by the mid-13th century BC, Senet had evolved into a more religious ritual. Some depictions from this time period forward show the game being played not by two people, but rather as a deceased player competing against an invisible adversary, interpreted by some to symbolize the deceased players own soul.\r\n\r\nThe board has become a metaphor for the afterlife with pawns moving across the board just as a soul moves through layers of the netherworld after death. Reaching the final space and leaving the board is the goal of the game, just as reaching Horus and leaving the netherworld was the goal for the Egyptians after their death for attaining rebirth with the gods Isis & Osiris, Sekhmet & Bastet holding the Egyptian Ankh or the papyrus scepter.\r\n\r\nThe game board consists of 30 squares or slots, arranged in 3 horizontal rows of 10. Pawns move from left to right through row 1, then drop down and move from right to left through row 2. Dropping down again, pawns move from left to right along row 3 and finally, off the board. The game uses the rules developed by Timothy Kendall in his 1978 work, Passing Through the Netherworld :The Meaning and Play of Senet, an Ancient Egyptian Funerary Game.\r\n\r\nThe game includes five special squares, governed by their own rules, each containing a hieroglyphic. Square 15 is the House of Rebirth; square 26 is the House of Beauty; square 27 is the House of Water: square 28 is the House of the Three Truths; square 29 is the House of Two Truths; and square 30, the last, is the House of Horus, the Egyptian falcon-god and lord of the sky.\r\n\r\nEgyptian Senet is a pharaonic challenging game that combines luck,strategy,and magic features authentic photos of ancient Egyptian temples,plus artistically crafted graphics and animation of an ancient stone game board and pieces,set in an echoing,tomb-like chamber.Ritualistic music plus sound effects of stone pieces moving recreate the atmosphere of predynastic Egypt.The App's Icon shows the Egyptian Queen Nefertari playing Senet in her tomb,she was the great wife of the pharaoh Ramesses II(Ramses)Rio. Also many Egyptian Queens have a similar photos playing Senet such as Cleopatra,Nefertiti the great royal wife of Akhenaten,and the Queen Hatshepsut the wife of Thutmose II.\r\n\r\nSupported Languages in year 2016 - 2017 - 2018 - 2019 : (English, Arabic, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese-Brazil)\r\nSuitable for everyone Adults and Kids.\r\nPerfect relaxing and time killer (timekiller) game with good prices for all countries.\r\nHighly Recommended for anyone interested in Egyptology, Archeology, Sphinx, Mythology, Archaic, Arcane, Agony, Edu, Monopoly, Atypical, Indiana Jones, Nancy Drew, Compulsive,Tic Tac Toe, Very Positive, Overwhelmingly Positive,Outstanding, Uncommon and Unusual Games.\r\n\r\nFor More Info (Information):\r\nSupport Email: ezzatstudios@gmail.com\r\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/EgyptianSenet ","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NTRZP9V0CMJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snowman Jump","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20058.14408484030261841.8ed85228-0010-4a36-84dc-b9679e066366.05bc339c-11ab-4bde-9211-60b2bacace96","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4353.14408484030261841.847e81b3-0634-4f4e-818b-208935c775b7.4367082f-5672-4bd6-a585-d86a99f6b8fd","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5754.14408484030261841.e6f8de4a-0af7-4b3b-9e55-caafd6dab001.5b9314b5-8c7e-4789-a72a-297c54afad38","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹54.00","Price":54.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["A-ZComputers.SnowmanHop_1wgt5v0x4j7z0"],"ContentIds":["c13bb05f-bde8-5838-8b55-1344306e4269","e02b1825-bfa5-7ee4-be05-b9563ad9b0ad"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In Snowman Jump, the goal is to guide the Snowman up a never-ending series of platforms without falling or getting knocked out.

Featuring vector polygonal lines and surfaces illuminated by pulsating neon lighting with immersive 360º action.\r\n\r\nEach of the 42 levels of the game have been carefully crafted with each formation requiring a different strategy to achieve best times. There’s a solid sense of progression and a steady ramping up of difficulty - ideal for introducing non-gamers to VR but challenging enough for more experienced players. \r\n\r\nLevels develop to include stronger gravitational forces, more isotopes, and new kinds of jeopardy. Boss levels with super-structures need new strategies, with a selection of power-ups such as slo-mo, shockwave and solar blossom mode adding to the fun. Your sassy AI sidekick Seren has always got something to say - but is mostly just sarcastic.\r\n\r\nUtilising the talents of three music producers (Forward Memory, Dynamix, and I Am Galactic), Neon features an original soundtrack of ambient electronica, synthwave and electro which complements the modern-retro styling of the game.\u2028\r\n\r\n“It’s like Tron had sex with an atom” -

That's where you come in.\n\nTacoma is a narrative adventure set aboard a high-tech space station in the year 2088. As you go about your mission, you'll explore every detail of how the station's crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.\n\nAt the heart of Tacoma is the facility's digital surveillance system, which has captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew's life on the station. As you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You'll use your ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing the multi-layered narrative as you explore.\n\nTacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling players deeper into the narrative than ever before.\n\nFeatures:\n\n·\tA Richly Layered Story Experience: Six crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships, experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.\n\n·\tA Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System: In each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine, and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes' chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.\n\n·\tA Deeply Interactive Gameworld: Explore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously exploring extensive records of the crew's digital communications and personal thoughts. Every facet of the crew's experience on Tacoma is part of your investigation.\n\n·\tA Vision of the Future: Experience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that depicts humanity's expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond. A deeply-imagined speculative vision of the near future from the award-winning story team behind Gone Home and BioShock 2: Minerva's Den.\n\n·\tA Compact Narrative Experience: Tacoma is estimated to take around 2 to 5 hours to complete. How deep you dig and how much detail you find is up to you. Tacoma is a non-combat, non-puzzle-focused game. The details of the story and gameworld are there for you to discover at your own pace.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P52CGZS62RX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO OVER TOP","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11798.14581798246459873.f5cb378a-0a20-4151-9eef-7e14878911b1.918cbec0-05a3-40ee-80d4-765558f87e51","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19131.14581798246459873.42992354-22f9-44b5-a5f2-95dd22ad3948.8c883937-f701-4de0-8ab3-53e6a44d0e83","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17218.14581798246459873.1ba81a01-4aa8-456c-b736-8eb3808f008e.23352923-77d7-4a14-825e-76c8b9f8feb0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21419.14581798246459873.48ef17dc-b0f0-4040-b807-70e8c98a9958.c3d95b2b-f856-4a18-9f8b-04387d779db4","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4138.14581798246459873.5071eeb9-97fb-4fcb-aa81-7e6f25817294.40c5df62-9376-44bd-8db6-1d10f235705c","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹499.00","Price":499.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOOVERTOP_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["fa657aed-1e49-8fb9-0bd8-a58ab1b32c67"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“OVER TOP” is a racing game released by SNK in 1996.\r\nPlayers will participate in breathtaking races through urban areas, mountainous regions, and snowy roads.
