Kids get to practice making their very own letters, both upper and lower cases, by carefully tracing the letter on a railroad track with their choice of train car.\r\n\r\n3. Garages with Surprises. Children are now tested to see if they can find the right letter. They need to open the correct garage, as their engine drives inside and pulls out a cargo car with a surprise.\r\n\r\n4. Phonics Cargo Train. This activity teaches children to identify correct letter sounds within the context of words. The child’s task is to load the correct cargo boxes into the train.\r\n\r\n5. Engine Search. Children get to think fast on their feet as they match upper and lower case letters before the trains have time to move away. Phonics is reinforced by hearing the letter’s sound after they make the correct

If you hit a certain amount of numbers then you win. What makes Caveman Keno more exciting over standard Keno is a neat graphical user interface with prehistoric creatures and an Egg Bonus which gives you the possibility for huge payouts up to 8x!\r\n\r\nWhile maintaining the similarity with the casino game, our iteration has several extras; Background Music, updated Sound, gorgeous Landscape Backdrops and a complete Statistical Database that tracks your play. Plus...A Horror Themed version with spine tingling music/sound, ghoulish images and flying bats a scattering.\r\n\r\nCaveman Keno is a pay once application. For only $1.99 you get the full game and all updates that come down the pike for free.

We've also released a brand new PC version of Chaos Control optimised for better desktop experience. You can find more info and download the new app on our website: http://chaos-control.mobi\r\n*******\r\n\r\nPeople don't usually achieve impressive results simply by being good at task management. It's the ability to set legitimate goals that makes the difference. Just write down your desired outcomes to make them real. This simple technique helps you to prioritize your goals before acting on them.\r\n\r\nChaos Control is a task manager based on the best ideas of GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology created by David Allen. Whether you are running a business, launching an app, working on a project or simply planning your holiday trip, Chaos Control is a perfect tool to manage your goals, juggle your priorities, and organize your tasks to get things done. And the best part is, you can handle both heavyweight project planning and simple daily routine like shopping list management in one flexible app. Also, Chaos Control is available across all major mobile and desktop platforms with seamless sync.\r\n\r\nHERE IS HOW IT WORKS:\r\n\r\n1) MANAGE YOUR PROJECTS\r\nProject is a goal combined with a set of tasks you need to complete in order to achieve it. Create as many projects as you like to write down all the desired outcomes you have\r\n\r\n2) ORGANIZE YOUR GOALS\r\nCreate unlimited number of projects and group them by category using Folders\r\n\r\n3) USE GTD CONTEXTS\r\nOrganize tasks from different projects using flexible context lists. If you are familiar with GTD you would just love this feature\r\n\r\n4) PLAN YOUR DAY\r\nSet due dates for tasks and make plans for any particular day\r\n\r\n5) USE CHAOS BOX\r\nPut all the incoming tasks, notes and ideas into Chaos Box in order to process them later. It works similar to GTD inbox, but you can use it as a simple to-do list\r\n\r\n6) SYNC YOUR DATA\r\nChaos Control works on both desktop and mobile devices. Setup an account and sync your projects across all of your devices\r\n\r\nThis app is designed with creative people in mind. Designers, writers, developers, startup founders, entrepreneurs of all kinds and pretty much anyone with ideas and desire to make them happen. We combined the power of GTD with the convenient interface to help you with:\r\n■ personal goal setting\r\n■ task management\r\n■ time management\r\n■ planning your business and personal activities\r\n■ building your routine\r\n■ handling simple to do lists, checklists and shopping lists\r\n■ catching your ideas and thoughts to process them later\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n■ Seamless cloud sync across all major mobile and desktop platforms\r\n■ GTD-inspired Projects and Contexts supplemented with Folders, sub-folders and sub-contexts\r\n■ Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly and chosen days of the week)\r\n■ Chaos Box - Inbox for your unstructured tasks, notes, memos, ideas and thoughts. Great tool for staying on track inspired by GTD ideas\r\n■ Notes for tasks, projects, folders and contexts\r\n■ Fast and smart search\r\n\r\nHave a productive day!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQBD6","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Web Design: WordPress Basics","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54746.9007199266659041.98608f69-ea09-43f4-9b84-550d734b55b3.3b0037cf-3586-4049-8730-32ccfd2fedf9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#F15A22","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AppDesigner.com.WebDesignWordPressBasics_s06ch29xky7de"],"ContentIds":["0e810433-5035-9efd-c2ee-21b9d26d984d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Wordpress is “the” software for creating blog sites.

Join music producer and trainer Rishabh Rajan in this course to learn advanced FL Studio workflows and production techniques!\r\nFL Studio is very unique and quite different from other DAWs. It offers many innovative features that make it ideal for producing electronic music. In this course, FL Studio expert Rishabh Rajan opens his bag of secrets to help you master this fantastic DAW.\r\n\r\nWith FL Studio’s very open and flexible architecture, there are often multiple ways to achieve the same result. Rishabh starts the course by looking at different techniques to produce that ducking effect often heard in dance music (spoiler: it’s not just about side chain compression!).

Encryption Standard (AES).  Data is stored independent of application and will not be deleted if application is uninstalled.  Decrypted data is accessible by any application installed on device.\r\n\r\nApplication provides two methods to encrypt and decrypt data.  Each method has advantages and disadvantages.  Choose which method to use depending on data size and intended use.\r\n\r\nFirst method places folder or file into an archive file and then encrypts archive file.  Files in folder cannot be seen since they were placed into one file.  Sharing content is simple since only one file needs to be exchanged.  Limitation of this method is it creates one large file to encrypt.  This method will exceed device memory limits more often than second method since encrypting one large file versus many smaller files.  This method is always slower than second method.\r\n\r\nSecond method encrypts individual files located in hierarchy of AES folder.  This method is always faster than first method since folders are not archived into one file.    Folders of any size can be encrypted.  File will not be encrypted if it exceeds device limit discussed above.  Application will show list of files not encrypted.  Limitation of this method is files in a folder are visible.  This limitation can be minimized by using generic folder and file names such as Folder01 and File01.

It features important breakthroughs in recent history of digital painting technology: 1. 3D brushes allowing expressive strokes as if done wielding a real brush. 2. Truly natural ink (watercolor) flows giving you the charm of water-based media. 3. Vector-like 12k output with raster richness.\r\n\r\nThe development traces back to 1999 when Computer Graphics researcher Nelson Chu started to devise a novel method to simulate a brush in 3D. By wielding such a virtual brush, you can make vastly different marks which normally require switching between many 'brushes' in other programs. By eliminating explicit switching you can finally make expressive marks that capture your rhythm.\r\n\r\nWater-based media have always been a challenge in digital painting technology. Many paint programs offer 'watercolor brushes', most of which are based on local diffusion or stamping scanned images. Nice results can be achieved but something important is missing - the fluidity. Our paint simulation, on the other hand, brings digital watercolor to a whole new level by using Computational Fluid Dynamics for natural flows. The use of GPU makes such a simulation fast enough for real-time interaction, even on a tablet computer.\r\n\r\nFinally, the simulation is paired with a new rendering method that gives you both raster richness and vector-like output up to 12k resolution. You can export your artwork with alpha channel to your favorite image editor for further processing.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPlease note that Expresii requires a good GPU to run smoothly. Not every system does have the right hardware so please try before you buy. If you encounter issue, please contact us at support@expresii.com before giving a bad review. We will try out best to help troubleshoot with you. Sometimes it's really the GPU hardware or the driver behaving incorrectly, not our app. We have over a dozen systems spanning different hardware and OS combinations of Windows 7, 8, 10, and nvidia, AMD or Intel GPU, and Expresii works fine on all of them.

That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test.

To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

try the aerobatic simulator licensed by the U.S. Navy!\r\n\r\nExperience flight at 400 mph just 18 inches from your partner’s wing and face the challenge of official maneuvers aboard F/A-18 fighter jets and a C-130 transport aircraft. An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level. This will give the you best scores and you will reach the top of the leaderboard!\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- F/A-18 fighter jets and C-130 “Fat Albert” transport aircraft\r\n- Innovative formation flying and assisted guidance system \r\n- All official Blue Angels maneuvers, playable in all roles\r\n- All configurations: takeoff, diamond, delta, echelon, line abreast and soloist\r\n\r\n- Use Airshow Mode to complete a real exhibition with a custom sequence of maneuvers\r\n- Additive Mode to create your aerobatic figure\r\n- Special missions: free flight, exploratory, pursuit and C-130 JATO\r\n\r\n- 3D Briefing display for easy understanding of the maneuver\r\n- Innovative help system with three difficulty levels to suit both beginners and more experienced pilots\r\n- Accurate

Create playlists with a specific ordering for performances.  Annotate the music pages with markings and notes.  Save a tempo for each song and use the built-in metronome to count off at the desired tempo. Also works with popular Bluetooth foot pedals.  Store the sheet music files on OneDrive and access it with the app on multiple computers.\r\n\r\nI wrote this app to help me keep track of the music for the different bands I play trumpet for.  I use it at rehearsals and at gigs.  I count off the songs for one of the bands, so I added a metronome feature to help with that.  We often play for a group of ballroom dancers that like a very specific tempo for some songs, so I added a way to set a song tempo that only applies to a specific playlist (so the tempo they want doesn't get in the way of the tempo we usually use for the song).  I use tags to indicate each song's style so when someone asks for a waltz or rhumba at a dance I can quickly bring up a list of songs and pick one to play next.\r\n\r\nIf you have some other features you'd like to see to make the app do what you need, shoot me an email and let me know.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

A horizontal panorama would better reflect the beauty of seashore, while a vertical panoramic image would catch a wonderful mountain view in its full splendor. PhotoStitcher helps you create nice panoramic images from individual overlapping photos in case you missed the opportunity to take a panoramic shot and only have scattered photos with varying perspective, angle and zoom.\r\n\r\nCreate perfect panoramas in one click!\r\nMaking a really nice panoramic photo of a city usually requires a wide-angle camera. Typical non-professional lenses simply cannot capture the entire view in one frame.

Check Print'R will automatically generate the word amount so you do not have to worry about spelling it out.

This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\r\n\r\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register). Balance is calculated automatically. Reconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\r\n\r\nPrint immediately or later, on top, middle, bottom, or three checks per page.

Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\r\n\r\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\r\n\r\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely in 1/72th inches.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT :\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nCheck Print'R is meant for personal productivity. For uses like payroll or other corporate use, better look towards other, specialized applications.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the MICR E13B font used in this application has been purchased by regional and national banks for their own use, after stringent tests. We are absolutely confident they will perform perfectly when used correctly. However, it is necessary to strictly follow these principles :\r\n\r\n1 - It is paramount never to use \"scale to fit\". Printing must be done at 100% to insure the MICR printing conforms to standard.\r\n\r\n2 - MICR Toner (magnetic ink) is mandatory to meet the American Banking Association MICR E13B standard and U.S. law (Check 21 Act). MICR E13B printing complies with ANSI X9.27-1995, ANSI X9.100-160-1-2009, and Canadian CPA006 standards.\r\n\r\nAlthough many banks today use Optical Character Recognition which accepts any ink, some are equipped with readers that require magnetic ink, and will be suspicious of checks printed with ordinary ink.\r\n\r\nMICR toner is indistinguishable of regular black toner, and can be acquired from fine office supply stores, Amazon, or other Internet toner vendors.\r\n\r\nIf you still have questions, or if you encounter any difficulties using this app, please use the support link to contact us, we will do all we can to help right away.\r\n\r\nYou can print the accompanying letter together with the check (Voucher) with Check Writer III, also available in the Windows Store.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9ND1F6WMN5BF","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Wallpapers 4K UHD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55750.13557691122071194.8c3c1c3b-9673-4cfb-969c-4ce6c141566b.f9937c02-b799-4ecc-929e-6650bd2ca966","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54944.13557691122071194.4edaf6a0-0050-41c9-b01a-ab587ca7be5a.dd53fb6a-3513-4dbd-9402-2dcb57668c4c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55750.13557691122071194.8c3c1c3b-9673-4cfb-969c-4ce6c141566b.f9937c02-b799-4ecc-929e-6650bd2ca966","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30525.13557691122071194.3048f66f-8e7b-4138-90dc-9a76489669bb.7a889a71-d33c-404f-8d40-c2682cefaf06","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7517.13557691122071194.5868d61b-0aee-4062-9565-745877ca35d5.c0ac0265-33b0-47ab-8322-be5e8a12e74f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"9","PackageFamilyNames":["368899solution.Wallpaperz_k8xs9gssn6ste"],"ContentIds":["7b8ba41c-437a-ae00-bea8-997711cf7717","7b2a2585-6330-674c-43c1-35031e166c65"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"   ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Choose your new background from 22 Categories like; 4K UHD, Seasons, Animals, Cars, Nature or Space, separated in 1-2 Pages per Category.

One such system is the ability to choose between “Power” and “Speed” styles when selecting a character. The “Power” system focuses on high damage while the “Speed” system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique “Hajiki” ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\r\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NF6GWWLNKPH","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Apex Legends Guide","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20332.13600626890051150.9c9d3613-69ed-4c78-a8e9-6c911c0b8d2e.bcc770ab-44ee-40f0-b066-c5fbff69b021","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26295.13600626890051150.9c9d3613-69ed-4c78-a8e9-6c911c0b8d2e.fb7223ae-f844-4ac5-86a1-34c5d4976b2c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54083.13600626890051150.9c9d3613-69ed-4c78-a8e9-6c911c0b8d2e.c7df92ab-d847-4c0b-b3bd-1a3d1e2aaf89","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37339.13600626890051150.9c9d3613-69ed-4c78-a8e9-6c911c0b8d2e.14e41493-e778-4bda-912a-a3445da5fa57","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35475MadenCompany.ApexLegendsGuide_x4z4m0t528c88"],"ContentIds":["c1faea66-81e8-760a-6a26-2caf56e40230","998980c3-db77-3e31-fb29-e27dfa09925f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Apex Legends Game Guide is now on the market.\r\nCharacter characteristics, All weapons and properties,\r\nAll articles and features, Scopes List, All Skill, all information related to the game is available.

Here’s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus:\r\nYour Will\r\nThe heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a “personal representative”) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. With Quicken WillMaker Plus, you can revise and update your will whenever you like.\r\nLiving Trust\r\nEnsure that your property bypasses lengthy and expensive probate proceedings. \r\nYour Health Care Directive\r\nSpare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions.\r\nHealth Care Power of Attorney\r\nName a trusted person (your “health care agent”) to make important medical decisions for you if necessary.\r\nLiving Will\r\nState what types of medical treatment you do or do not want if you are too ill or injured to direct your own care. Your health care providers must do all they can to follow your wishes.\r\nYour Durable Power of Attorney for Finances\r\nA durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your “agent” or “attorney-in-fact”) will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these.\r\nYour Final Arrangements\r\nPlan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more.\r\nDocuments for Your Executor\r\nMake sure your executor has needed forms and instructions to do the job: checklists, letters, notices and claim forms.\r\nInformation for Caregivers and Survivors\r\nOrganize your information so that your survivors don't have to. Use this document to give them details about everything from bank accounts, to passwords, to the names of people you’d like contacted in the event of an emergency. \r\nCreate the following forms with

They understood, much better than any other people at that time - the art of economics. From their trading centers in the Baltic Sea, Birka and Haithabu they sailed the seas and developed extensive trade routes from Russia to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe game considers all aspects of Vikingism in a fantastic and realistic 3D world - trade, economics, and combat to a degree that may have been in the real life of a Viking.\r\n\r\nGoal is to build a robust economic system with a flourishing maritime trade under realistic climatic and seasonal conditions. Only with the income of your island production, the merchandising and the reward of fullfilled tasks - you’re able to fulfill the claims of your lord - Thorvaldson.\r\nBut apart from the harsh climate and other bad circumstances, the multitude of enemies are the biggest threat to your prosperity and your life. As a loyal swordsman of Thorvaldson, you will receive guard troops and can protect your village with massive weapons. Protection that you need to defend you properties and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOther information about the game:\r\nThe presentation of the figures, the calendar and the seasons, are largely based on historical traditions and geographical conditions. At the presentation of battle scenes, however, in order to increase the thrill, we have used a little bit of fantasy.\r\nThe in-game time of the game is divided so that 1 hour of real time means a day in-game. This results in a varied and long lasting playing time in which you can do your daily work.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn ongoing more about the details of the game, we recommend that you follow us on IndieDB: https://www.indiedb.com/games/vikingjourney\r\n\r\nHere you will ongoing articles about the Gameplay and new Features.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHQJB7P9B61","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO TOP PLAYER’S GOLF","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49933.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.f4f40d98-c592-4169-8afa-55936539592f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61958.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.89e317f3-227a-4dde-afd3-2d15127ba2bb","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27245.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.219645e6-e2f3-4c72-a977-a285c23844dd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47576.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.bb31dfcb-47db-46e6-a88b-6a7db4ea6496","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47368.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.02614cf1-6d8a-425c-a168-bbf88a4e267f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$7.99","Price":7.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOTOPPLAYERSGOLF_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["cd128cc9-16f0-3479-7613-29a4adc9f360"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"TOP PLAYER'S GOLF is a sports game released in 1990 by SNK.

Users can easily enjoy genuine Asian calligraphy and ink wash painting with a simple and intuitive user interface imbued with the Zen spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Windows universal app version of Zen Brush 2 already supports the Surface Dial and the new Surface Pen with tilt support, providing the feeling of a real ink brush by reflecting the brush's tilt and orientation.\r\n\r\nMain Features :\r\n\r\n■3D Ink Brush Simulation\r\nThe app includes a drawing system based on a 3D model of an East Asian ink brush. Strokes change according to the movement of the user's finger or pen, providing a sensation just like a real ink brush for a uniquely varied and deep expressiveness.\r\n\r\n■Ink Nijimi and Notan\r\nUsers can select from 3 types of ink dispersion (nijimi) and enjoy the complex, three-dimensional expressiveness of ink-wash painting where the ink gradually soaks into washi (Japanese paper). The thickness of the ink (notan) can also be adjusted to reproduce shades ranging from dark, thick ink to light, diluted ink so users can create subtle artwork by combining shadowy depictions and light coatings.\r\n\r\n■Abundant Style Templates\r\nArtwork expressiveness is enhanced by choosing from a collection of 92 rich background style templates, including washi (Japanese paper), old paper, patterned paper and many more.\r\n\r\n■Support for Surface Dial and Surface Pen\r\nWith Surface Dial, users can use Zen Brush features intuitively without needing to touch their keyboard and mouse. Thanks to support for the Surface Pen's pressure sensing and the New Surface Pen's tilt detection, users can enjoy an even more realistic ink brush experience.\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n\r\n- 92 background style templates.\r\n- Simple brush size adjustment with slider.\r\n- Simple main tools: ink brush, red brush, eraser brush.\r\n- 3 levels of ink dispersion (nijimi).\r\n- 3 levels of ink tone (notan).\r\n- Guide lines (9 types).\r\n- Undo / redo (5 levels).\r\n- Save projects in the app.\r\n- Save artwork to image file (formats: JPEG / PNG / Transparent PNG (without background)).\r\n- Sharing (transfer data to other supported apps. Example: email).\r\n- Adjustable pressure sensitivity (5 levels).\r\n- Adjustable tilt sensitivity (5 levels).\r\n* Requires a pen that supports tilt.\r\n- Supports Surface Pen (eraser supported).\r\n- Supports Surface Dial (undo / redo, brush size adjustment, tool switching (ink brush, red brush, eraser), zoom in / zoom out, style change, brush axis rotation, 90 degrees canvas rotation).","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

types of businesses: Cars, rockets, phones, tanks, trucks, airplanes, computers, and ships. Design, produce, market and sell them. You can even run multiple companies at the same time.\r\n\r\nStart by creating a company: First, choose what to produce. For example, you can design cars (combustion engine based, electric, hybrid), then produce, market and sell them. Other types of products are trucks, phones, computers, ships, airplanes, tanks and even rockets. Once you are successful, you can even start more companies, and run them at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet market demands, you need to design your products so that customers will actually want them, and won't prefer to buy your competitors products. Research new technologies and design new products as your move on to fit into a moving market. For example for cars, you want to research bigger and more efficient batteries, if you decide to produce electric cars, or more performant combustion engines if you want to produce gasoline or diesel based cars.\r\n\r\nThe game is running in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time.
