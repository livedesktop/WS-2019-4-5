for US/EN QWERTY keyboard layout - \r\n\r\nGreat for homeschooling. Contains typing games.\r\n\r\nTyping Fingers uses a completely new approach to teach the efficient touch-typing (ten-fingers) system. It makes typing fun, is interactive and works with modern technologies and a new teaching method. The beautiful design and peaceful music create an amazing atmosphere that allows everybody, including children, to improve their typing skills and get TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA after  successful completion of all levels.\r\n\r\n*** SYMMETRIC SUPER LEARNING ***\r\nTyping Fingers uses a modern teaching approach based on brain analysis. The SYMETRIC method helps to activate both  brain hemispheres equally in the process of learning and playing the game. The user maps the keyboard symmetrically and symmetrical patterns are repeated again and again during the whole game.\r\n\r\n*** GET A TYPING FINGERS DIPLOMA *** \r\nWin the game and get Foriero's Typing Fingers diploma! You can get exactly the same diploma as you see on the screen shots except with your name and date of game completion. Just print it and stick it on the wall and everybody, even you, will be proud that you have successfully completed TYPING FINGERS.\r\n\r\n*** 32 LEVELS WITH INTERACTIVE TUTOR ***\r\n(In-App Purchase is required for 31 of levels) \r\nIn all the 32 lessons a \"Tutor\" called \"Dennis\" will help you to learn which fingers are for striking which keys. The levels are built up gradually, so you learn how to use your keyboard in a fun and easy way.\r\n\r\n*** LEARNING AND PLAYING MODE ***\r\nEach lesson is divided into two parts. The first one is for learning purposes. In this part Dennis helps you to memorize letters and symbols and to practise the correct motion.\r\n\r\nThe second part is a game and you have \"ONLY\" three lives to beat the level. Work diligently, ardently and persistently and you´ll get it!\r\n\r\n*** WRITE US ***\r\nIf you have any ideas or notions or just feelings on how to improve this\r\napp you can always press the WRITE US button in the game and send us your feedback and wishes. We will be very glad to incorporate all your input into a new version.\r\n\r\nThank you","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NNS1","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"App Installer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24251.13510798887475206.1ae35c73-aa3c-4b3b-bccb-76e17071afae.5cb790a8-3d3b-4a7d-bddd-74846ee18ab4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55657.13510798887475206.c531deb0-97f8-462f-b826-056fca02c5a1.0ad672b9-f66f-4c4f-9126-ceb1dcc1bcb6","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36049.13510798887475206.3ca2470a-aebd-41f3-b883-292b49329aba.ff5fb9bf-366a-4d6f-9db1-0f227090e1d2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50903.13510798887475206.d525bc88-237c-4a58-8a36-81895196be31.284790a5-94a1-4cdd-8f18-da2173581578","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26033.13510798887475206.926063a8-5db1-4cca-b0af-1e1bbd8d4d4d.509abc02-dd09-49dc-9d24-ac380b662e1d","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33061.13510798887475206.34a5b1cc-aab2-4ec5-ac80-54aecc0eb29a.fb80a0d9-dd99-4cfc-92c3-e937dd0dc5c9","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39364.13510798887475206.f2b23b19-6bf3-4da4-aef0-67cb00d3e49b.f40e537b-c970-4d27-b2cd-88c3ed313fdb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37521.13510798887475206.cee0593b-aa37-415a-976d-64f1e5c7675c.683188a3-e2c5-4714-beb3-a81050cd9e44","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29876.13510798887475206.d16b1229-e5b8-4b2e-acf5-d29ea34aa260.b7ad2437-d3ee-4609-800e-4e0d197c2491","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["97612282-d1e8-1d6a-9e92-c271e7f177ef","4da40c6e-4aa9-e8b2-3377-5f85a28fe1ea"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Microsoft App Installer for Windows 10 makes sideloading Windows 10 apps easy: Just double-click the app package, and you won't have to run PowerShell to install apps.

It is appropriate for preschool students, Kindergarten students, grade 1 and 2 students, and even ESL (English as a Second Language) and ELL (English Language Learner) students.\r\n\r\nThe study of Sight Words is an important part of the process of learning to read. The goal is for these words to be studied until they can be instantly recognized by the reader. There are 2 main sets of Sight Words: Fry's and Dolch's. This app utilizes Fry's first 100 Sight Words (or Instant Words) since they include the most commonly used words in the English language which are consequently the most important ones to learn first. Many of these first 100 words are also found in Dolch's Sight Words.\r\n\r\nThe 100 Sight Words included in this app are the 100 most commonly found words in the English language. In fact, approximately 50% of all words that are printed in books, magazines, etc. are these 100 Sight Words. These are the most high frequency words in the English language.\r\n\r\nThe first 25 Sight Words (found in Level 1 of this app) make up approximately 33% of all words that are published in books, magazines, etc. Levels 2, 3, and 4 contain the remaining 25-word sets of the first 100 of Fry's Sight Words.\r\n\r\nThis app does contain advertisements via Google's AdMob service, but no ads will be displayed from categories that Google labels as sensitive.\r\n\r\nThe study of Sight Words aligns to Common Core State Standard CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.3.C.\r\n\r\nNote that the process of learning to read should not be limited to the study of Sight Words. It is also crucial to practice phonics and to read with others.

In this transaction, money does not actually change hands until some agreed upon future date\r\nSwap Forex Trading - The most common type of forward transaction is the foreign exchange swap. In a swap, two parties exchange currencies for a certain length of time and agree to reverse the transaction at a later date.\r\nFutures trade - Futures are standardized forward contracts and are usually traded on an exchange created for this purpose. The average contract length is roughly 3 months. Futures contracts are usually inclusive of any interest amounts.\r\nOption Trade - A foreign exchange option (commonly shortened to just FX option) is a derivative where the owner has the right but not the obligation to exchange money denominated in one currency into another currency at a pre-agreed exchange rate on a specified date.\r\nLibor - The London Interbank Offered Rate is the average interest rate estimated by leading banks in London that the average leading bank would be charged if borrowing from other banks. It is used as a reference in the forex market.\r\nForex Risk aversion - Risk aversion is a kind of trading behavior exhibited by the foreign exchange market when a potentially adverse event happens which may affect market conditions. This behavior is caused when risk averse traders liquidate their positions in risky assets and shift the funds to less risky assets due to uncertainty.\r\n\r\nCarry Trade - Currency carry trade refers to the act of borrowing one currency that has a low interest rate in order to purchase another with a higher interest rate.\r\nForex Signals - Forex trade alerts, often referred to as “forex signals”, are trade strategies provided by either experienced traders or market analysts.\r\nThe foreign exchange Market – The entire currency exchange activity is estimated to be many trillions of dollars, 24/7 trading, and high liquidity markrt\r\nInvestment Factors - theories that explain the fluctuations in exchange rates in a floating exchange rate regime (In a fixed exchange rate regime, rates are decided by its government)\r\nEconomic Factors - economic policy, disseminated by government agencies and central banks, and economic conditions, generally revealed through economic reports, and other economic indicators.\r\nPolitical Conditions - Internal, regional, and international political conditions and events can have a profound effect on currency markets\r\nMarket Psychology - Market psychology and trader perceptions influence the foreign exchange market in a variety of ways as we will learn more in this forex course.\r\nTrading Manipulation - A country may gain an advantage in international trade if it controls the market for its currency to keep its value low, typically by the national central bank engaging in open market operations.

Test it with Cinebench!\r\n\r\nCinebench leverages the same powerful 3D engine found in the award-winning animation software Cinema 4D Release 20 to accurately evaluate CPU rendering performance capabilities across various systems and platforms. \r\n\r\nFor over a decade, Cinebench has been a popular tool to evaluate hardware performance. Cinebench scores are used by system administrators to help make purchase decisions, journalists to review hardware, hardware manufacturers to optimize their latest products, as well as computer owners to evaluate their individual system. \r\n\r\nImprovements to Cinebench Release 20 reflect the overall advancements to CPU and rendering technology in recent years, providing a more accurate measurement of Cinema 4D's ability to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and modern processor features available to the average user.\r\n\r\nCinebench R20 FAQs:\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 uses a much larger and more complex test scene than R15 requiring about 8x the computational power needed to render it. The test also requires about 4x the memory. Therefore R15 and R20 results cannot be compared.\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 and Cinema 4D R20 incorporate the latest rendering architectures, including integration of Intel’s Embree raytracing technology and advanced features on modern CPUs from AMD and Intel that allow users to render the same scene on the same hardware twice as fast as previously. \r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 provides improved benchmark accuracy for current and next generation CPUs to test if a machine runs stable on a high CPU load, if the cooling solution of a desktop or notebook is sufficient for longer running tasks to deliver the full potential of the CPU, and if a machine is able to handle demanding real-life 3D tasks.\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 does not test GPU performance.\r\n\r\n•\tCinebench R20 will not launch on unsupported processors. On systems lacking sufficient RAM to load the test scene, a warning will be displayed and the CPU benchmark will not be executed.\r\n\r\n•\tBackground tasks can significantly influence measurement and create diverse results. It's always a good idea to shut down all running programs and disable any virus checking or disk indexing, but it's impossible to eliminate all background processes. Modern operating systems perform various background tasks that cannot or should not be disabled, even though they could have a minor influence on the results.\r\n\r\n•\tTest results can vary slightly because it's impossible to disable every background task of the operating system. These tasks are one factor that may have a slight influence on measurements. Also, modern computers and graphics cards dynamically adjust clock speeds based on environmental conditions like power and temperature. For instance, processors will reduce clock speed when running too hot to allow for cooling and prevent damage. With many modern processors the reverse is also true. They are able to overclock themselves when the temperature is low enough. So, a system freshly started in a relatively cool environment will typically run faster than the same system that has been performing benchmarks for several hours in a heated office.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

All functionality remains the same however there are some features that dont work due to store policy, or are limited (like some file associations, and the run options). This is a published centennial application. All Credit to the original Notepad++ team, all the heavy lifting of creating an awesome app was done by them.\r\n\r\nThis is currently Notepad++ version 7.5.9 (updated in this update)\r\n\r\nCode and changes required for publishing is located here: https://github.com/NightRi-se/notepad-plus-plus\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1.   Default Plugins can not be removed or updated\r\n2.   Custom plugins CAN NOT be loaded AT ALL on Windows 10 S (on other versions of windows, it is possible to load them from %appdata% - but ensure your plugin version matches your build version [x86/x64]).\r\n\r\nWe are working on including a selection of plugins by default for future versions. Current we have included MarkdownViewer++ and Compare plugins by default.\r\n\r\nNotepad++ is a free (free as in both \"free speech\" and \"free beer\") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and natural languages.
