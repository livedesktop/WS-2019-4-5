The game is played with a standard deck of cards (including 2 jokers). \r\n\r\nPlayers are dealt a total of 12 cards.  The remaining 6 cards are dealt face down into the 'Kitty'.  Each player will bid starting clockwise from the dealer (dealer bids last).  \r\nThe bid consists of a bid number and description.  The bid number is the number of tricks (books) a player believes his partnership can achieve over 6. For example, a bid of 4 = 10 books. \r\n\r\nThe bid description indicates a bid direction (High or Low) or whether the bid is a 'No' trump. A bid direction of High (Uptown) indicates A,K,Q... are the highest value cards. A bid direction of Low (Downtown, Special) indicates A,2,3... are the highest value cards. A 'No' trump bid indicates that each suit has equal weight and the lead card can not be 'cut'.  The bid direction of a 'No' bid is specified after winning the bid.\r\nBid numbers can range from 3 - 7.  The Option screen gives the player the option of playing with a minimum of 3 or 4.\r\nBid descriptions have the following weights:  'No' > 'Low' > 'High'.  The Option screen allows the player to play make 'Low' and 'High' equal in weight: 'No' > 'Low' = 'High'. \r\n\r\nThe highest bidder indicates a 'trump' suit or in the case of a 'No' bid indicates the direction (High/Low).  The jokers become the highest value cards in the indicated 'trump' suit.  For example, if Diamonds were called as 'trump' the highest value cards for a 'High' direction would be:  Big Joker, Little Joker, A, K,...  In the case of a 'No' bid, the Big Joker and Little Joker have no value and should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bid winner will start play as the lead player.  The remaining players must play a card in the same suit as the lead card if available. If the player does not have a card in that suit they may play another suit. The highest value card in the lead suit wins the sequence unless a trump card is played in which case the highest trump card wins the sequence. The winner of the sequence will be the lead player in the following sequence. \r\n\r\nGame Options\r\n\r\nPractice Mode:  The computer will not bid.  Allowing the player to always win bid and practice different plays.\r\nScoring - Conventional and Progressive:  With Conventional scoring the bid winner may go into negatives if the bid is not acheived.  Progressive scoring will award points to the opposition team if the bid is not achieved.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4RGS5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mythic Wonders: The Philosopher's Stone (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40912.13510798887412178.3ce16187-b017-4b36-be26-8330bbb77c98.eb5f81bd-4283-4914-9128-bd99a5c2d7d2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 6,99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.MythicWondersThePhilosophersStoneFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["1029f537-d665-0e65-3370-c8c094e8aff6","05664ac9-b4cf-16ae-d5f0-d302645a96fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nEnter the mythical portal and search for your missing uncle in the new hidden object adventure game!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmma wakes up from a scary dream: mysterious creature threatens her uncle Alfred.

They understood, much better than any other people at that time - the art of economics. From their trading centers in the Baltic Sea, Birka and Haithabu they sailed the seas and developed extensive trade routes from Russia to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe game considers all aspects of Vikingism in a fantastic and realistic 3D world - trade, economics, and combat to a degree that may have been in the real life of a Viking.\r\n\r\nGoal is to build a robust economic system with a flourishing maritime trade under realistic climatic and seasonal conditions. Only with the income of your island production, the merchandising and the reward of fullfilled tasks - you’re able to fulfill the claims of your lord - Thorvaldson.\r\nBut apart from the harsh climate and other bad circumstances, the multitude of enemies are the biggest threat to your prosperity and your life. As a loyal swordsman of Thorvaldson, you will receive guard troops and can protect your village with massive weapons. Protection that you need to defend you properties and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOther information about the game:\r\nThe presentation of the figures, the calendar and the seasons, are largely based on historical traditions and geographical conditions. At the presentation of battle scenes, however, in order to increase the thrill, we have used a little bit of fantasy.\r\nThe in-game time of the game is divided so that 1 hour of real time means a day in-game. This results in a varied and long lasting playing time in which you can do your daily work.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn ongoing more about the details of the game, we recommend that you follow us on IndieDB: https://www.indiedb.com/games/vikingjourney\r\n\r\nHere you will ongoing articles about the Gameplay and new

After your child uses Friendly Math a few times, the app will start choosing questions that gently challenge your child's ability without discouraging progress. The goal is to achieve that sweet spot where questions are not too easy and not too difficult to achieve maximum benefits.  \r\n \r\nMy motivation for developing Friendly Math grew out of watching my two children interact with various math apps over the years. I noticed that some apps were too harsh on the kids, using negative scoring which resulted in a lot of tears and frustration. Other apps were timed games offering multiple choice answers. My concern with those was that kids learned to quickly press the correct buttons without much understanding of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nFriendly Math was developed to address some of these concerns. With Friendly Math, children are not timed in order to allow them time to think, consolidate knowledge, and truly understand problems. Incorrect answers are not penalized and the app often offers second chances. I believe that this approach encourages the spirit of learning and experimentation. Positive reinforcement is used, not negative scoring. This prevents children from forming negative attitudes towards math and protects their self-esteem. The apps' simple visual design helps children focus on math with minimal distractions, so that learning can easily be transferred into school testing and real life scenarios. \r\n \r\nFriendly Math provides your child with rewards in the form of collectible achievements. For best effect, parents are encouraged to provide additional positive reinforcement by linking app achievements with additional rewards. You know best what works for your child, whether it is extra pocket money, screen time, taking them on a trip or nothing at all.  Each achievement is unlocked by answering 100 questions correctly, which can be done in a session or two. Ideally, your child should be encouraged to use the app a few times a week, so 3 or 4 achievements a week should be optimal. Again, a balance should be achieved here.  Too little use may not provide optimal benefits, but too much use may result in negative attitudes and fatigue. Again, you know best what is optimal for your child. \r\n \r\nFriendly Math can be used by up to five children providing they are sharing a computer. It is important that every child is playing under his or her \"login\" as the app tailors questions to your child. If they have dedicated devices, you will need a separate license for each child.  \r\n \r\nFriendly Math lets you install the app on multiple devices and the progress will follow your child as she changes devices. So, your child can start on one device and continue playing on another.  \r\n \r\nI have done my best to design Friendly Math for special accessibility requirements, but I have limited resources for testing this. If you find something is not working optimally in terms of accessibility, please email me so that I can improve it. I am really keen to get this right!\r\n \r\nIf you encounter any bugs or problems, just drop me an email. I can usually fix issues quickly. No call centers here, I will personally reply to your emails.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P9NNM33KQW8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tee Time Golf","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10838.14139280557658485.7db4c1e5-6e1e-43c6-9443-0e8f46b3e91b.e5e3d868-c3ab-4cd7-b6b4-d445a3d49f01","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49279.14139280557658485.913a446e-53fd-4999-a56c-0555306a3480.c0be0075-7702-4120-a982-e9489fefbef0","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24297.14139280557658485.894dacbf-6e14-4b67-83a4-88470c43d1d4.99677612-72ed-473b-8fde-b8468b52ca71","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48951.14139280557658485.669c5feb-d00a-4cba-a865-e0c2c8f92a0b.ca58d6a4-1962-48ef-894f-29f6c1bec473","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58604.14139280557658485.ca1ca2db-2a37-49de-a12a-b4b9c53e3fda.9cd849d0-1477-4c7b-b790-be3803dd836a","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64139.14139280557658485.af3e61be-1ecc-4001-9eba-d49c2568733a.9c2f46bc-aadc-49a4-836e-f52fb6d209cc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48236.14139280557658485.a72dd67d-8405-411c-8e49-30697ecd09ba.f9340dba-659a-4a8c-b630-14ad7bdf7e8f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 14,99","Price":14.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BarkersCrestStudioLLC.95183933F9A_j8azhsya6t5f6"],"ContentIds":["ee864df2-abe8-3155-1145-75f77c3b26d3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"**Xbox Live Multiplayer & Publish and Download Courses now available**\r\n\r\nAre you ready to build a Golf Course in VR and then play it?\r\n\r\nTee Time Golf is the sequel to the hit Xbox Indie title Avatar Golf, but this time around you get to swing the club.

Build the Railroad. This activity is a fun way for children to learn the name and the appearance of each letter in the alphabet. Kids will enjoy as each station lights up with the announcement of a letter.\r\n\r\n2. Drive the Train. Kids get to practice making their very own letters, both upper and lower cases, by carefully tracing the letter on a railroad track with their choice of train car.\r\n\r\n3. Garages with Surprises. Children are now tested to see if they can find the right letter. They need to open the correct garage, as their engine drives inside and pulls out a cargo car with a surprise.\r\n\r\n4.

This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

Laura and Tim go to ski resort hoping to distract Laura from heavy thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere, on the edge of the world, misfortune befalls her. Tim goes out of the house in a fit of lunacy and falls off the cliff. He did not die, but is in a coma. It is not hard to guess that the fall off the cliff and coma are caused by intrigues of the Sandman.\r\n\r\nIt would seem what might be easier for Laura, having the absolute Power, to awaken her husband? However, being received the Power, Laura has made a commitment not to use the Power for her own benefit. This means that she can’t help Tim to wake up. And she has 2 choices: watch how her beloved slowly dies in the hospital, or have recourse to the help of an old friend again who once helped her when she was in a coma.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura met an old friend (the player), she stops the time to pass by the doctors unchecked and infiltrate in Tim’s ward, and then she immerses the player into the subconscious of Tim, whose body is almost seized by the Sandman.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman operates under the old scheme: by sending nightmares, he suppresses the will of the victim to resist.\r\nWill the player have time to wake up Tim before the Sandman turns him into his heir?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVD38FX2FVZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Alchemy Classic Premium","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49786.13795250873814794.cbe72cb3-6f26-49e2-998d-e238a45ed78e.f34c5f9f-85bd-489d-a6ef-48d4b3f2dd0e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#48449a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58183.13795250873814794.0d75f012-1e63-42ca-8d58-9ac6d120f867.b2bacd6a-0055-4dde-9f34-dfe84ea328b6","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#48449a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11614.13795250873814794.302ac3af-4a08-4f20-97b3-db67b2686a25.0ac77a05-5971-4acf-9cc3-784a771b70cd","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#48449a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7842.13795250873814794.71b845db-42a5-4e9a-8ac5-b72792894c5a.f9b66932-88c1-46af-b372-69fbef2d744e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#48449a","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 2,99⁺","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["56831Niasoft2.AlchemyClassicPremium_8q3wtsa1725tc"],"ContentIds":["c689b0fc-96f9-3c2e-47c4-94a6a4e74631","adb404dc-1f95-9873-b8c3-1265e40610fc","aa0986e7-db75-db46-1141-2427ef2ee4f2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you love addictive puzzle game?

That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun. Add some good-times to your tables, with Multiplication Dragons!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1P61X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dinosaur Hunt: Africa Contract","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46362.13510798885977021.a9de7c41-0423-4d28-92f7-c3d9c677a709.4c44ab7c-6cb1-42fb-a0f0-8826f4a4fb58","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60365.13510798885977021.743b8b2e-3ab4-40a7-8319-6e26666c2759.1f4e3401-ab08-4a3f-a12b-26b5ff4a23b7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 0,99⁺","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["ANPAPawelTerlecki.DinosaurHuntAfricaContract_b0r4pe453fpr0"],"ContentIds":["601419d5-48f4-b32d-e061-73b027c48ec3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Could you knock out T-Rex with a sledge hammer? \r\nCan Stegosaurus survive bazooka strike? \r\n\r\nCan you cut raptor with Katana?\r\n\r\nIs shotgun as effective as it sounds against Ankylosaurus?\r\n\r\nWhat is the experience with shooting crossbow at Brontosaurus? \r\n\r\nHow does the Triceratops Jaw looks like from the INSIDE? \r\n\r\nExperience realistic extreme dinosaur age shooter that comes with dangerous shooting, hunting and survive simulator game!\r\n\r\nThrough sands, jungle, swamps and ice track dangerous rex and other carnivores and Aim and Shoot! \r\n\r\nULTRA realistic graphics!

Upon the detectives’ arrival, one of the hospital’s therapists falls out of the window to his death.\r\nAs their investigation begins, the detectives learn much darker things are happening at Mnemosyne Asylum than they could have guessed. None of the patients are willing to speak about the devastating fire that engulfed the hospital four years ago, or the fire’s victims. The staff do everything they can to obscure the asylum’s past, and keep the façade of peace and order intact.\r\n\r\nEach new clue only raises more questions. Who killed Doctor Crow?

scared, the shelter airlock smashes down behind you. You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do. It would be easier to give up. But you don’t. The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. “Daddy you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times. In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube...\r\n\r\nSheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”. Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future.\r\n\r\nWith all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you'll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying. Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter. You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your families survival for just one more day.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

De vernieuwende verhaallijn is uiterst meeslepend en je zult volledig opgaan in een wereld waarin fantasie en een post-apocalyptische realiteit samengaan wanneer elk leven wezen met het verspreiden van het Duister te maken krijgt.\r\nDe jonge Alice is gezegend met een grote kracht, de kracht van de Vlam. Op een dag vond ze in een vreemd kistje een ei. Toen ze het aanraakte kwam er een vuurvogel uit het ei waarna haar leven voorgoed veranderde. Sindsdien verschijnt de vogel regelmatig uit het merkteken op Alices arm om het tegen het Duister op te nemen… Welke kracht heeft Alice bemachtigd en is er een manier om het te beheersen?... Nu de vuurvogel bij haar hoort, maakt Alice deel van de eeuwige strijd tussen het Duister en de Vlam uit.\r\nHet Duister blijft naderen en Alice gaat, samen met haar oom Colin, op een reis vol wonderen en avonturen die hun levens bedreigen.\r\nTegelijkertijd zit Colin keer op keer in zijn eigen nachtmerries gevangen.

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

With huge excitement, boys and girls decorate the Christmas tree, make sweets, deck out the house and look forward to their presents. These coloring pages depict your favorite Christmas characters and the main symbols of the festive season. The coloring process gives every kid the feeling of the Christmas holidays drawing near.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste. Try the program right now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKKWF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Simply Pinochle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38717.9007199266525172.4a78381e-78b3-49fa-b756-5387507cee85.fcdaf380-1722-447b-b0ce-8d91c582c542","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"€ 2,29","Price":2.29,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38236CardsFun.SimplyPinochle_wvhqmvdkxmhhc"],"ContentIds":["f298a4df-668f-bd36-9fe4-055b49d2cd1c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pinochle is an exciting and challenging game of cards very popular in the U.S. This is the two handed version of the game in which you play an intelligent robot.
