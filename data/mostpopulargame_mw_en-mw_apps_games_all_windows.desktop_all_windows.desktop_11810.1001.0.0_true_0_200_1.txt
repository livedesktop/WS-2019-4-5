It's for babies, toddlers, or anyone who benefits from learning about shapes, patterns, matching, and early motor skills.  The default mode is to connect two shapes by tapping one and then the matching one. When two shapes are connected, a light tone is played, and when all the shapes on the screen are connected, a fun WIN sound is played. Ads are included to keep the game free, and for a small fee they can be removed... but if you like the game, it would be great if you could click an ad every now and then.\r\n\r\nSettings are accessed through the Windows 8 Settings interface, making it less likely for your little one to need to ask you for help if they get into it.  You can set up the game to:\r\n\r\n* Tap, drag a line, or draw a line to connect shapes. Tapping works great for children under 2 years old.\r\n\r\n* Match either 2, 3, 4, or a random number (between 2, 3, and 4) of shapes on the screen.\r\n\r\n* Choose between connecting 2-dimensional shapes, 3-dimensional shapes, or 3-dimensional outlines.\r\n\r\n* Race - Play 5 games with the current settings. The total time is shown, and if the previous best time is beat, the winner can save their name. This mode ended up being surprisingly fun for parents and older siblings.\r\n\r\n* Enable or disable sounds.\r\n\r\nThis game is for the best people around, and I hope you and your child enjoy it as much as my young testers did. Thanks for trying it out, let me know if there are any problems, and if you like it please give it a positive rating.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Statement: This application does not collect any of your personal

This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PMNV9SVNTJ7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Archery King Master 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62996.14290046672162924.6d5f41a8-905b-4b5e-85e2-7a978f09a732.0a27b2f5-2050-4d21-b864-c15ee3897284","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56362.14290046672162924.6d5f41a8-905b-4b5e-85e2-7a978f09a732.bb37e542-f730-421a-916d-b1c48899a54e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62996.14290046672162924.6d5f41a8-905b-4b5e-85e2-7a978f09a732.0a27b2f5-2050-4d21-b864-c15ee3897284","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2121MagicCraftGames.ArcheryKingMaster3D_6nzhqfnh355zm"],"ContentIds":["aec78b25-f639-fa10-c013-601dcc8577bc","6cd33695-c797-cae2-15e6-0b46939d5b98"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The best archery game!

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\r\n- Play with 4 decks\r\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\r\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\r\n- Player can split twice\r\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\r\nWhen hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\r\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1DSS5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dumb Ways to Die 2: The Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49274.13510798885875426.977352e1-ecc5-44c8-9f06-ef5bc9d03bc8.df76d92f-4f85-4e87-9cf1-ca1594def2b5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.53101.13510798885875426.087aeb13-b724-4713-8704-d74d784e0947.a9308442-11e2-46ee-ab47-a1d10b5c6f5c","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.64849.13510798885875426.820c1451-c14a-45dc-9c50-9a6d4c07d875.fc44abd7-ad3b-410d-ac17-1a5cb5cb1cc9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.59256.13510798885875426.bee72027-c012-418f-9555-9bbedb6bc0f8.87c137da-fd12-414b-a02b-3cdce4a9773a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13558.13510798885875426.fb17d1e1-4a70-452d-9bd1-aaf3e788cf6c.10a7d82b-00df-4431-8c6c-09f779e66cc7","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49479.13510798885875426.3a604534-8c9a-4416-8ce1-e97b4fe890a8.2dbb7cfe-118d-4531-b2d4-f24b7bd5683b","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34599.13510798885875426.8b00b405-a2ce-49e4-aca0-8a1c01105e2c.04a46442-a627-489a-9bb3-a0b654e2db02","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#89AF00","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["METROTRAINSMELBOURNE.DumbWaystoDie2TheGames_yq4mzw6f7hyga"],"ContentIds":["a9523f7f-6a6a-4761-4558-622fcb50f58a","685ef8aa-0403-83cf-880f-7e283df725c6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"There’s a whole new set of dumb characters that have gathered to take part in a newer, bigger game.\r\n\r\nGuide these characters through 52 action packed mini-games and try to stay alive long enough to get the highest score and unlock all your favourite characters.\r\n\r\nVisit the multiplayer challenge arena and battle against your friends.\r\n\r\nPledge allegiance to your favourite Dumb Ways character and play for global domination on the team leaderboard.\r\n\r\nDownload the FREE game now and become the dumbest of the dumb.

So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVQKB35TDN7","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Connect Bubbles Classic","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59281.13854353299840592.21b6a9bd-6f60-4348-89ad-8c2096f82893.ce1ec240-679d-49ef-aac9-bd3ba744f2ce","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.248.13854353299840592.21b6a9bd-6f60-4348-89ad-8c2096f82893.f1916016-1c39-4e2d-9128-c83f7b54323b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28772.13854353299840592.21b6a9bd-6f60-4348-89ad-8c2096f82893.0e6e4073-16e6-4847-9949-5319a099ac1a","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GSoftTeam.ConnectBubblesClassic_65ca9qnt7cjzg"],"ContentIds":["b5f01df0-7189-4bdb-9fc6-d6d04a3caeb0","46299dca-80db-07c9-fb55-03c08768b98b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From the makers of Connect Bubbles, a new game filled with challenges and fun!
