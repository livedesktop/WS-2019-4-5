Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime TV from ‘home’.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should you try TVMucho?\r\n\r\nWe, the makers, live abroad ourselves. Yes, we are expats too. When we first moved to another country we quickly found out that local TV providers don't offer much. To be honest they offer nothing at all. \r\n\r\nOver time we tried everything. An expensive satellite dish system, that was complicated to install, and it kept losing the signal in bad weather. We watched online TV over the Internet. Turns out most channels are blocked overseas and those we did get were of poor quality.\r\n\r\nSo here we were... Trying to watch TV from our homes… It was Complicated, Expensive, Low quality and really uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTVMucho a solution for all expats, by tech-expats?\r\n\r\nSo we gathered around the table and set out to build our own solution. \r\n\r\nOh, did I mention our team has people from 12 different countries?!\r\n\r\nSomething that was easy to use, would work everywhere, allowed for full flexibility across devices, but most of all would bring our home country TV experience over to our new home abroad.\r\n\r\nThe result... TVMucho.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does TVMucho work\r\n\r\nWith TVMucho we can all watch our home country TV, directly ON the TV. And on all our other devices too, wherever we are. \r\nWe can watch our favourite Live TV from home whenever we want. TVMucho... Live TV from home.\r\n\r\nIt’s really easy to use, with a TV Guide, catch up and recording! You don’t need any complicated software or expensive equipment to enjoy watching live TV. TVMucho is genuine Plug and Play.\r\n\r\nThere are no restrictions or hidden fees with our IPTV, just watch what you want and when you want. It’s easy. The app and Internet. ...sit down, relax, and start viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is TVMucho\r\n\r\nPerfect Picture Quality. The brilliantly designed user interface offers the easiest experience you can imagine. Full broadcast quality... and HDTV where available.\r\n\r\nTVMucho is More than just clever software!
