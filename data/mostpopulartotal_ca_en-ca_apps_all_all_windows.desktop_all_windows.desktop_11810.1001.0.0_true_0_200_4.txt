It presents Disney’s Typing Adventure in full-screen size and rich color with beautiful animations for the optimum typing experience for kids. No other Typing tutorial is more motivating while educating the learner.   \r\n\r\nKids go on an exciting adventure in Typelandia with Mickey Mouse and Friends. They begin their adventure in the Village where they discover a mysterious enchantment has befallen Typelandia. Kids must learn all the keys on the keyboard as they travel through Typelandia to free Mickey’s friends from the enchantment. The first stop is the garden where they discover Daisy transformed into a shrub. By learning to master the first set of keys, a, s, l, and ; they will help free her. To do so, they take a typing lesson, complete a challenge, and reinforce their new skills by playing a game. Upon passing a test, Daisy is free and back to herself! Mickey’s Typing Adventure is packed with so much fun and motivation, kids forget they are learning to type. “Boring” is not a word you’ll hear as kids continue their Adventure in each charming location, including The Cottage, The Wishing Well, The Big Tree, The Mine, and finally the Palace!  Mickey’s Typing Adventure is the perfect typing solution for parents, too, as kids will not need help as they are guided step-by-step by the Shop Keeper who travels with them in a crystal ball. He helps kids progress through the Adventure using just the keys they have learned. \r\n\r\nPacked with Motivation\r\nKids are motivated to learn new keys, pass typing tests and complete challenges to free Mickey and his friends from the enchantment. After completing typing activities throughout Typelandia, the ultimate reward is reaching the Palace. Once at the Palace, kids discover what caused the enchantment and Mickey and his friends are free! The Palace is a fun place with more adventures, activities, and challenging games – complete with a colorful Fair! \r\n\r\nExciting Places to Visit\r\nKids can take a break from their typing adventure at any time to explore Typelandia. The Arcade in the Village has an awesome game room where kids can choose to play any of Typelandia’s games – except the exciting bonus games only available in the Palace Arcade. They must reach the Palace to play those games. Kids can choose to take more lessons or challenges in the Village Academy, and they can practice their skills by typing excerpts from favorite Disney stories like Rapunzel, Cinderella and more! \r\n\r\nAdventurer Tools\r\nTypelandia has several Adventurer tools to help kids to find their way around. In the Olde Village Shop, they can take a tour to learn everything about Typelandia! The Map helps kids see where they are on their Typelandia Adventure, where they are going next, and what keys they will learn. Kids can display a variety of graphs in the Saved Results area to see their performance on all their typing activities; lessons, challenges, stories and even games. They can see their progress and the keys on the keyboard they need to practice.\r\n\r\nHours of Fun\r\nTypelandia has unique games to keep kids interested in learning. Games encourage repetition which builds finger-to-key memory. Before they know it, they are well on their way to becoming Touch Typists! Games can be played in a wide variety of ways; at varying levels of difficulty to keep kids interested in continuing to the next level.

drawing tool with nondestructive Boolean operations, smart shapes, gradient fills, shadows and so on built exclusively for tablets and hybrid devices on Windows 10.\r\n\r\nIt’s ideal for the creation of all types of vector graphics and art for web and print: logo design, banners, sketches, marketing materials, icons, infographics, conceptual art and more. \r\n\r\nThanks to XAML export option it's also unique drawing tool for Windows Store and WPF developers.\r\n\r\n• Built with touch and pen in mind. \r\nAphalina Designer was developed from the ground for Windows 10 and hybrid devices such as Microsoft Surface to be equally usable on both tablets and desktop PC’s. The app natively supports all kinds of input devices: stylus, touch, mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\n• Nondestructive Boolean operations.\r\nYou can edit parts later, switch Boolean effect off and on from the Layers panel, or convert result into editable curves at any moment\r\n\r\n• Simple – easy to learn, easy to use. \r\nMinimum tools, concepts and controls - just enough to get your design job done. Instead of trying to invent another all-in-one Swiss-army-knife drawing tool we removed everything that can prevent you from creating clean vector shapes.\r\n\r\n•       Noise free UI. \r\nNothing should stay between you and your work. We believe that all you need to be creative is a pen and a sheet of paper; UI should be hidden until you really need it. The screen space is super valuable on tablets and ultrabooks, so we put absolute minimum of UI control elements on the screen. \r\n\r\n• Set of nondestructive smart shapes such as star, gear etc.  \r\nYou can change shape settings at any moment by using smart handlers or convert to editable curves when you need it.\r\n \r\n• State-of-the-art drawing and graphics editing capabilities. \r\nUnlimited undo\\redo, move, resize, rotate, skew, grouping, layers. Linear, radial and image fills, opacity, opacity masks, shadow effects. Powerful spline shapes editor– everything you expect from vector graphics.\r\n\r\n• Really affordable. \r\nNo subscriptions, no hidden fees: basic edition is free to use, premium features can be enabled by one-time in-app purchase. You can use purchased edition on multiple systems without any additional fees.\r\n\r\n• Modern drawing engine under the hood. \r\nFast drawing engine based on the latest version of Microsoft Win2d technology.\r\n\r\n• Hand-draw shapes recognition. \r\nFast shape recognition system – draw commonly used shapes with a pen.\r\n\r\n• Html5 ready. \r\nHi-quality SVG export and import. Export to PNG and Jpeg is also supported.\r\n\r\n• XAML Export.\r\nBoth Windows Store and WPF Xaml dialects are supported.\r\n \r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PK1BPWQ6BXG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Stormhill Mystery: Family Shadows","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25971.14271817602188265.3740c674-35de-4e96-9dd5-3ba5301a68cf.4e43e5af-18cc-46b3-abd7-969a43ee5bbc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25971.14271817602188265.3740c674-35de-4e96-9dd5-3ba5301a68cf.4e43e5af-18cc-46b3-abd7-969a43ee5bbc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20493.14271817602188265.721f9ca5-1083-4b18-bc0b-0e4025da6faa.ee2330eb-e6b3-44f9-978b-f7eef11a52cf","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62819.14271817602188265.721f9ca5-1083-4b18-bc0b-0e4025da6faa.5236fa94-6209-4002-a1fc-c9ac95c77cda","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"CAD $8.99","DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["15138SpecialbitStudio.StormhillMysteryFamilyShadow_epzyba63485cc"],"ContentIds":["926cb90f-25ef-78f0-0c37-33970743c345"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE CAD $2.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Stormhill Mystery: Family Shadows is a fantastic casual puzzle adventure game.

However, their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual … although there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his beloved wife from her cursed world.”\r\n\r\nYears have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: “Your favorite fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is waiting in our old family home.”\r\n\r\nAs a son, I must “write” the happy ending for my family’s story.\r\n\r\nThis puzzle adventure is perfect for playing while traveling.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PFMS0DL3ZW6","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Photo to Video slideshow maker - Aniroket - FREE to try","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26201.14197505698691915.8b623d61-77b7-4412-8ae6-567ffc0a5cc8.bf9c34a6-17cc-4139-a5b7-ac25b26a065d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45403.14197505698691915.a0da3c29-a49b-4960-90ca-0c08a80fb485.d1960cf7-c304-4216-9bf4-1dc13122c4e9","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7983.14197505698691915.16b62b34-df91-4a31-b390-f73bb88c7c8c.6a92a8a0-e527-4c55-a610-feb253cf61e1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11889.14197505698691915.10bcd711-1ca0-4b59-af82-5ea7be833c31.df6f2bcd-45ba-426d-be2d-c51ff69156d6","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18053.14197505698691915.71c9a0e5-3db0-4d4b-a953-f470328ec558.f26443e8-8e4e-4a18-9350-a6f432ad0d0e","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28431.14197505698691915.d05e778d-df1f-461b-8eb0-565d871e6df1.b652f6cc-1135-48cd-8f21-0793ea7bedc9","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12639.14197505698691915.9b0179cd-2f64-458c-ba42-727b8465eb8f.b4fea520-9916-4e5a-8498-2111f90f95cc","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28096.14197505698691915.90957d8d-8489-4104-9c16-e6d5c517d5d7.5264bca0-d8dc-4f99-b19f-f340974ee7a3","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23201.14197505698691915.d948d289-93f2-481d-8d3c-48c9ea1cbfdb.aa36703a-e779-424c-9fb5-399dca4e50de","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31684.14197505698691915.3848d5e2-856a-43d9-ac82-a0fad3ad78b7.1246b838-8c34-48f0-8820-3d755a1efda2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#EBEEF1","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"5","PackageFamilyNames":["289A8416.PhototoVideoslideshowmaker-Aniroket_4b6qtthrfy11p"],"ContentIds":["f47599ba-6968-4667-3b7c-ed797b1f5ea0","11878bb1-baa9-3b23-37c5-1ac917bcba93"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A video slideshow from photo maker with a rich library of backgrounds and animations.

Vince’s adventure takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine.\r\n\r\nIn true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n• Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" \r\n\r\n• Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. \r\n\r\n• Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. \r\n\r\n• Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game clips.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZKFMV","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Stopwatch + Timer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4420.13510798883208951.4e8d752f-7102-4d7a-a664-e387130d1d75.f72510a8-8991-4339-a711-2e62838776fb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46897.13510798883208951.684f9db3-1d90-47b4-88b1-4f3a3160c1d1.b4304024-559a-490a-8e8b-7cfdee2a870e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40824.13510798883208951.28bc5164-129a-4fbe-8553-5c0750e5590b.c3053745-95a0-4bf6-b805-f169a765bfca","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24287.13510798883208951.e788de22-80d4-4c93-bd2c-5bbe912f8591.3ab47180-e01f-40af-93fb-a5d7fecd962b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"18","PackageFamilyNames":["25342asdf3333.StoppuhrTimer_1xbryz0n7krfa"],"ContentIds":["abfb666f-a1cf-d861-75f1-d86daf569dbe","dec812c5-171e-174e-3a9e-f0dac8345a6e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a simple stopwatch and timer (countdown) in one app. Use Cortana to interact with the app.\r\n\r\nNow completely for free and without ads!

Win against the computer or friends by place all cards in sequential order from your own pile before your opponent does. Take the top place in the world player rankings.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n- Realistic AI opponents. No cheats!\r\n- Customize your game by choosing the number of opponents, cards in the stockpile and  game difficulty.\r\n- Play online together with friends or family everywhere: Smartphone, PC or Mac.\r\n- Chat with online opponents\r\n- Unlimited undo\r\n- Scoreboard with player rankings\r\n- Resume games after pause\r\n- Help for the beginners\r\n- No frills.\r\n- Browser game at https://skipoid-nexus.appspot.com for PC or Mac.\r\n\r\nGame rules:\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to be the first player to play out their entire stock pile. \r\nEach player is dealt 10 (20 or 30) cards for their stock pile with only the uppermost card visible, and a hand of five card. \r\nThe shared play area allows up to four build piles, which must be started using either a \"1\" card or a '*', and each player also has up to four personal discard piles. \r\nEach turn the active player draws until he has five cards in hand, and plays on the build piles. He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
