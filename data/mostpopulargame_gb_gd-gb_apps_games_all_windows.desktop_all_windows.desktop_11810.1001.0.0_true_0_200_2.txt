One such system is the ability to choose between “Power” and “Speed” styles when selecting a character. The “Power” system focuses on high damage while the “Speed” system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique “Hajiki” ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\r\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3G2JR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Draw a Stickman: EPIC 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61392.13510798884252984.925616a2-fbdb-4b06-9d7d-17cad27437da.78716c3b-5db7-44b4-8b66-fc5e4dec7d0a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38874.13510798884252984.23bfe3c5-20d9-46e3-88cf-a79182fb224b.c4d535a8-c2e4-4da5-bac5-86d5ad4c1264","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56916.13510798884252984.ddbd57cd-545c-47ba-af92-3ab805c0ed47.f23e8f34-1c22-471f-a0f6-d527578f7045","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20848.13510798884252984.e0a8c1f2-34b6-442f-b37a-03ca82c6b82e.2a81f670-5970-48a4-812e-1ee47ddaab6c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34055.13510798884252984.3d4acc45-dd24-43d0-b912-4747150122d2.42ec5aff-2c8c-4159-b07d-9c2ed1ea013f","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52764.13510798884252984.41c52aee-aa1d-49cb-a1e1-f739325f7b03.ac2571bb-c7d4-4251-bcd9-b99e19c2ce96","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63458.13510798884252984.c5bcb197-cd5b-46ce-9dee-1c96364d42f7.5809e829-7375-4666-a24f-ae788e8933f8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56949.13510798884252984.0b836109-347f-4da2-8d34-ae36d12e50d0.90eeef25-cf1c-444b-a298-b3c4dc9bad76","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41290.13510798884252984.1b5f6c77-0b94-4931-b22f-a3f5701a1e09.b6d83d6e-1439-4528-9620-810106d0baa7","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"72","PackageFamilyNames":["AED7303B.DrawaStickmanEPIC2_vadkk3ne967kw"],"ContentIds":["b2cacd8f-6c1b-7050-b6fc-1ea04001d9eb","ec80c056-c8a1-7b31-ecd9-2f5bf62560c7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"** Winner of 5 Webby Awards - Draw a Stickman Franchise **\r\n** Played over 100 Million Times around the Globe **\r\n\r\nGrab your pencil and get ready for the most creative DRAW A STICKMAN adventure yet!\r\n\r\nImagination is the key, as you enter a magical storybook full of mystery and wonder, unusual creatures and enigmatic puzzles!

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed.

You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle. Sophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate you to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Reentry, an orbital simulator.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter.

Game Studio Tycoon 3 gives you the chance to simulate a fully functional game development studio!  Do you have what it takes to beat the competition and become the best studio in the industry?\r\n\r\n• Start on your own in a small office, and grow your gaming business to owning 7 buildings and managing 50 employees while tasking 3 independent teams of game developers to produce different projects at the same time!\r\n\r\n• Build your video gaming business alone, or try to get help from investors.  A unique investor system allows you to sell off part of your company for money when you’re in a pinch!\r\n\r\n• Develop games for devices from 50 years of gaming history as well as the near future.\r\n\r\n• Create your own video games and even MMO’s!  Determine the level of support for your MMO games, create updates, and run advertisement campaigns to attract new users! \r\n\r\n• Create your own hardware!  You can create a traditional console, handheld device, or even a mobile device (tablet/phone).  Once your hardware is released you can try to increase your market share by investing in third party developers to produce games for your hardware.  Every game you release on your own hardware can help increase your market share!\r\n\r\n• Set the price for your games and hardware.  Lower priced products tend to sell more, but turn less of a profit – find the right balance to capitalize!\r\n\r\n• Participate in 3 yearly conventions, each targeted at different types of fans.\r\n\r\n• Incredibly complex fan and user system.  Each fan has a genre preference, and platform preference, and an age.  On top of that, your fans will grow older as the game progresses!\r\n\r\n• Compare your studio against 7 AI studios and compete for yearly awards.\r\n\r\n• Analyze and strategize!  Pour over various charts and graphs to determine what games you should make and decide what direction to take your company in.\r\n\r\n• Plan your game projects and hardware ahead of time.  You can queue up to 3 projects for each team to work on for a total of 9 projects.  This means when a team is done with their current project, they will move on to the next one right away!\r\n\r\n• Take a gamble and make games for big publishers!  However, publisher deals rely on your past projects so be sure to have a high average game rating!\r\n\r\n• Certify your employees in 8 different technical fields to help improve their performance.\r\n\r\nChase your dream and get immersed in the ultimate tycoon adventure of the Game Development

It won't take long for the original message to get lost in translation and turn into something completely different. You'll love the suspense of waiting to find out what the next person thought your drawing was – it's hilarious to see the whole game when it's finished!\r\n\r\nDon't know what to draw? That's fine – join a game and you'll get a description to illustrate in any way you like. You have 10 minutes to draw it before it is given to the next player to describe! Feeling a bit shy about drawing? You can choose to just describe if you like – and move the game on by being as detailed as you can!

By combining two men you can create a single more powerful man who is able to kill weaker men. The twist to the game is that the more powerful a man that you create is, the more expensive he is to maintain.
