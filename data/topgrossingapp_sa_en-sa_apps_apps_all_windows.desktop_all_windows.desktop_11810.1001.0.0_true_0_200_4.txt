Open the app to take the register and it shows the name and picture of all the pupils in your class. If you need to mark a pupil late, the app automatically indicates the current number of minutes past the class start time. \r\n\r\nAll of the data used by the SIMS Teacher app is encrypted so that confidential information cannot be accessed by unauthorised personnel.

Your support keeps Video Jack the top-rated FREE Windows Video Player.\r\n\r\nVideo Jack is a free player that plays all of your downloaded movies, TV shows, and personal videos. It plays all popular movie files, including WebM, MP4, MKV, FLV, and many others. \r\n\r\nEnjoy your movies the way they were meant to be seen. Video Jack has simple controls that hide during playback for seamless, full-screen viewing. See your videos in full resolution and with high-fidelity audio. \r\n\r\nVideo Jack is simple, fast, and unobtrusive. It starts up instantly and doesn’t hog your device’s resources - it only runs when you need it. It’s even simpler than other video players: it doesn’t keep a history of what you were watching, or interrupt you with annoying popups and update prompts.\r\n\r\nThere’s no complicated controls to figure out, codecs to install, or extra software to use. Just start Video Jack, press “Open Video\", and your movies will instantly start playing.\r\n\r\nVideo Jack supports 3G2, 3GP, AAC, AVI, FLV, M4V, MKV, MOV, MP4, WM, WEBM, TS, and almost all other types of videos (as well as most audio files!) - it’s feature-packed behind the scenes, but simple and friendly to use. \r\n\r\nNOTE: This app does NOT contain any in-app purchases or feature limitations. It is 100% free. \r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH35H6H","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"sketchometry","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.43105.13510798885206720.594b2f87-da1f-4753-a078-3a7831451ae2.c9400d09-7476-4b47-a434-abe4f37fe629","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.52469.13510798885206720.4077822d-4d27-413e-a842-4ac325814461.e09a503e-3883-4300-b11f-49ce4343e8a6","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.5612.13510798885206720.64df8b14-810b-47d9-ad87-ee91a50d5bf3.fa32ebd1-2113-4939-a5c1-6731a18f7e10","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.27361.13510798885206720.bd762994-b850-4970-86d9-da002bf5abf9.9e5ebc2c-d00c-4007-8e36-0e9cfb0ff967","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6547.13510798885206720.ac470a67-0b57-41a1-9a2c-2ec1bd0cb73a.00b76371-5b93-4135-94f1-2207249513d8","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.31319.13510798885206720.7f4989a2-8d71-489a-87c4-b651f69b1042.76672955-062d-4473-8041-3f2ffedb05ba","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.16210.13510798885206720.94120788-e369-4b6a-9bba-3b605f764988.56df3403-3979-4517-a996-66e05f073c43","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.37647.13510798885206720.9220aa8c-ff97-443d-a54f-051315b4c104.ea6a46b4-96d9-48bd-92ed-0389f785c4b3","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.991.13510798885206720.ec815cc2-9422-4887-bf33-35c1ddf8d6d8.a03e55ab-f618-4ec6-a634-e431e0eac964","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#3366ff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["ForschungsstelleMobilesLe.sketchometry_hjpk36ztej6x2"],"ContentIds":["00d18881-94c1-0e3a-d347-96d9e6ba8f33"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"sketchometry is an interactive construction and exploration tool for plane Euclidean geometry.
